# sqlbuddy

The goal of this application is to solve tedious daily tasks for myself and my co-workers. The app is continually growing as I find new use cases and identify new module opportunities. Below is a list of the current modules and the use case:

- SQLBuddy: helps the user to convert scripts from MS SQL to Snowflake and convert in clauses to inner join
- SQL Line Generator: allows the user to add aggregate or other prefix clauses to a list of column names
- Text Comparison: allows the user to compare to strings and calculate a similarity score or display the differences 
- Uppercase Conversion: allows the user to convert strings to uppercase
- Address Parser: allows the user to upload an xlsx file of addresses and parses the addresses into its constituent parts
- GDP converter: helps the user convert between two data models
- Text Finding Wizard: allows the user to search a string for a substring and return X number of surrounding characters
